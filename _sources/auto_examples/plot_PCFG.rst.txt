Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG)
=========================================

This is an example of defining a simple discrete RBN equivalent to a PCFG.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 9-12

Defining the PCFG
-----------------
We use an :class:`AbstractedPCFG <rbnet.pcfg.AbstractedPCFG>`

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 12-14

.. code-block:: default

    from rbnet.pcfg import AbstractedPCFG








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 15-16

First we define a number of words (terminal symbols) of different categories that sentences can be composed of:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 16-24

.. code-block:: default

    subjects = ["I", "You", "We", "They"]
    verbs = ["run", "drink", "sleep"]
    adverb_non_gradable = ["a-lot", "alone"]
    adverb_gradable = ["fast", "slowly", "quickly"]
    grade = ["very", "veeery", "really"]
    verb_qualifier = ["rarely", "do-not", "never", "always"]
    terminals = subjects + verbs + adverb_non_gradable + adverb_gradable + grade + verb_qualifier








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-26

Then we define some non-terminals symbols (a start symbol and one symbol for each category of words used above):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-34

.. code-block:: default

    non_terminals = ["start",
                     "subject",
                     "verb",
                     "gradable_adverb",
                     "non_gradable_adverb",
                     "verb_qualifier",
                     "grade"]








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-36

Finally, we define the rules and give them a weight (for simplicity we use a weight of 1 everywhere):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-50

.. code-block:: default

    non_terminal_rules = [("start --> subject verb", 1),
                          ("verb --> verb_qualifier verb", 1),
                          ("verb --> verb gradable_adverb", 1),
                          ("verb --> verb non_gradable_adverb", 1),
                          ("gradable_adverb --> grade gradable_adverb", 1),
                          ("grade --> grade grade", 1)]
    terminal_rules = []
    for non_terminal_symbol, corresponding_list_of_terminal_symbols in zip(
            non_terminals[1:],  # skip the start symbol
            [subjects, verbs, adverb_gradable, adverb_non_gradable, verb_qualifier, grade]
    ):
        for terminal_symbol in corresponding_list_of_terminal_symbols:
            terminal_rules.append((f"{non_terminal_symbol} --> {terminal_symbol}", 1))








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-52

Now we can define our PCFG by providing it with the terminals, non-terminals, rules, and start symbol.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 52-56

.. code-block:: default

    pcfg = AbstractedPCFG(terminals=terminals,
                          non_terminals=non_terminals,
                          rules=non_terminal_rules + terminal_rules,
                          start="start")







.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-61

Parsing Sentences
-----------------
Let's test the grammar by computing the marginal likelihood of some grammatical sentences
(which should be greater than zero) and for some un-grammatical ones (which should have zero marginal likelihood)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 61-76

.. code-block:: default

    for sentence in [
        # grammatical
        "I run",
        "You never run",
        "We run very veeery slowly",
        "They always run alone",
        "I never sleep really very quickly",
        "You do-not drink very quickly",
        # un-grammatical
        "I You",
        "run fast"
    ]:
        marginal_likelihood = pcfg.inside(sequence=sentence.split())
        print(f"{sentence} --> {marginal_likelihood}")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    I run --> 0.011999999999999997
    You never run --> 0.00023999999999999992
    We run very veeery slowly --> 4.095999999999997e-06
    They always run alone --> 1.9199999999999992e-05
    I never sleep really very quickly --> 1.638399999999999e-07
    You do-not drink very quickly --> 1.0239999999999992e-06
    I You --> 0.0
    run fast --> 0.0




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 77-79

We can also print a simple textual visualisation of the parse chart, which shows
``non-terminal symbol|inside probability`` at each location

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-81

.. code-block:: default

    pcfg.inside(sequence="You never run".split())
    print(pcfg.map_inside_chart(precision=2).pretty())
